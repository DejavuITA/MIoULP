\section*{Abstract}
We replicate a method for multidimensional characterisation of ultrafast laser pulses.
The technique is based on Fourier transform spectral interferometry and is spatially resolved in three dimensions.

The sample beam is interfered with a copy of itself delayed and passed through a pinhole, therefore spatially uniform.
The interferogram is acquired on each pixel of a CMOS camera by scanning the delay between the sample and the reference pulse and allow us to gather high-resolution spatially resolved information on the phase difference between the two pulses.
This information is then elaborated by mean of Fourier transform along with the spectral intensity and phase obtained with a SEA-F-SPIDER.

The result is a complete characterisation of the original pulse in three spatial dimensions (or two plus time).

\section{Introduction}
Modern mode-locked lasers are able to generate ultrafast laser pulses with a duration down to few femtoseconds \cite{tamura93,schriever14,yu30} and with high repetition rates.
Those pulses are too short to be characterised by any present-day detector, therefore autocorrelation, spectroscopic and interferometric techniques are largely used in laser metrology.

** talk about those techniques **

Autocorrelation techniques are the easiest techniques available, but they also allow only a superficial characterisation of the laser pulse.

Frequency-Resolved Optical Gating (FROG) is a spectrographic method

Spectral-Phase Interferometry for Direct Electric-field Reconstruction (SPIDER) is an interferometric method

** talk about those techniques **

Those techniques are usually implemented considering the laser pulse transversely homogeneous.
This is often not the case, because distortions in the pulse spatial distribution may be introduced even by the simplest optical element \cite{bor}.

Mutidimensional characterisation of a ultrafast laser pulse is not simple: for example, the FROG and the SPIDER techniques can be scaled to allow one spatial dimension characterisation.\\
\textit{Being able to obtain the 3D distribution of a laser pulse with those techniques is not as simple.}

\subsection{Aims}

The aim of this project is to obtain a complete spatial and temporal characterisation of an ultrafast laser pulse, that is a (3D) three dimensional characterisation.
%The aim of this project is to spatially and temporally characterise an ultrafast laser pulse of \SI{3.5}{\fs} duration.
The source is a Ti:Sapphire laser which generates \SI{30}{\fs} pulses, successively spectrally broadened by a hollow core fiber and temporally compressed by broadband chirped mirrors into the final \SI{3.5}{\fs} pulse.

Our plan is to build a Mach-Zender interferometer to obtain a spatially resolved interferogram of the laser pulse, and convert it to the frequency domain via Fourier transform.
Then, by adding information on the frequency dependance of the phase and the intensity, gathered using the SEA-F-SPIDER already available in the laboratory, to characterise the beam spatial distribution in three dimensions.

\section{Fourier transform spectral interferometry}
Among the different techniques, we have chosen to develop a spatially resolved version of the Fourier transform spectral interferometry.
This method is based on the interference between the test beam and a small homogeneous portion of a copy of itself.
\subsection{Crosscorrelation interferometry}
Consider an unknown laser pulse, its time complex field and the corresponding field in the spectral domain are given by
\begin{gather}
	U(t) = |U(t)|e^{i\phi(t)} \\
	\tilde{U}(\omega) = |\tilde{U}(\omega)|e^{i\psi(\omega)}
	\label{eq_def}
\end{gather}
The camera measure the intensity of the pulses over a time much longer than a single cycle, therefore we may write that for each delay $\tau$:
\begin{align}
	I(\tau) 	&= \int|U(t)+U_r(t-\tau)|^2\mathrm{d}t \\
			&= \int|U(t)|^2\mathrm{d}t + \int|U_r(t)|^2\mathrm{d}t\\
			&\quad + \int U(t)U_r^*(t-\tau)\mathrm{d}t + \int U^*(t)U_r(t-\tau)\mathrm{d}t 
	\label{eq_autocorr}
\end{align}
As we can see the first two terms are actually just the irradiance of the test beam $I_0 = \int|U(t)|^2\mathrm{d}t$ and of the reference beam $I_r = \int|U_r(t)|^2\mathrm{d}t$ and are therefore constant for each value of delay $\tau$.

Those component may be isolated and subtracted to the interferogram either by separate measurement or by removing the peak at $\omega = 0$ in the frequency domain.
\subsection{Fourier transform spectral interferometry}
A special case of the autocorrelation interferometry is the Fourier transform spectral interferometry.
It is based on the information gathered by the autocorrelation interferometry.

By applying the Fourier transform to Eq. (\ref{eq_autocorr}) we obtain
\begin{equation}
	\mathrm{FT}\lbrace I(\tau)\rbrace =
	\mathrm{FT}\lbrace\int|U(t)|^2\mathrm{d}t + \int|U_r(t)|^2\mathrm{d}t\rbrace
	+ \tilde{U}(\omega)\tilde{U}_r^*(\omega)
	+ \tilde{U}^*(-\omega)U_r(-\omega)
\end{equation}
where $\tilde{U}(\omega)$ is the spectral domain complex field, as in Eq. (\ref{eq_def}).

The first term is the Fourier transform of a constant and is represented in the frequency domain by a delta at $\omega = 0$.
The second and third terms are represented by two peaks around $\omega_0$ and $-\omega_0$, where $\omega_0$ the main frequency of the pulse.
Considering only the second term, which can be isolated from the term at zero and at $-\omega$, it may be rewritten as:
\begin{equation}
	A(\omega)=|\tilde{U}(\omega)||\tilde{U}_r^*(\omega)|e^{i[\psi(\omega)-\psi_r(\omega)]}
\end{equation}
and finally, we get
\begin{equation}
	\tilde{U}(\omega) = |\tilde{U}(\omega)|e^{i\psi(\omega)} = \frac{A(\omega)}{|\tilde{U}_r^*(\omega)|}e^{i\psi_r(\omega)}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Multidimensional approach}
\begin{equation}
	\tilde{U}(x,y,\omega) = \frac{A(x,y,\omega)}{|\tilde{U}_r^*(x,y,\omega)|}e^{i\psi_r(x,y,\omega)}
\end{equation}
assumptions:
\begin{itemize}
\item the intensity of the reference beam is homogeneous in the transverse directions $|\tilde{U}(x,y,\omega)|=|\tilde{U}(x_0,y_0,\omega)|=|\tilde{U}(\omega)|$ where ($x_0$,$y_0$) are the coordinates of the center of the beam.
\item the phase is separable as a spatial component and an angular frequency component:\\ $\psi_r(x,y,\omega) = \psi_{r,sp}(x,y)\psi_{r,\omega}(\omega)$
\end{itemize}
Then:
\begin{equation}
	\tilde{U}(x,y,\omega) \approx \frac{A(x,y,\omega)}{|\tilde{U}_r^*(\omega)|}e^{i\psi_r(x,y)}e^{i\psi_r(\omega)}
\end{equation}

\section{System setup}
\subsection{Laser Pulses Source}
**
Our source of ultrafast laser pulses is a Ti:Sa laser which generates pulses of \SI{30}{\fs} with an energy of \SI{700}{\milli\J} at a repetition rate of \SI{1}{\kHz}.
Those pulses successively are broadened in spectrum in a \SI{1}{\m} long hollow fibre and then compressed in time by ultrabroadband chirped mirrors, to obtain at the end of the process a ultrafast laser pulse of \SI{3.8}{\fs} duration and energy up to \SI{250}{\milli\J}.

**
As prealignment tool we used an HeNe laser, generating a collimated red beam of wavelength $\lambda_{HeNe}=\SI{632.8}{\nm}$ with a long coherence length and small beam waist.

\subsection{Mach-Zender interferometer}
\input{system_scheme.tex}

The two arms of the interferometer have two mirrors to avoid retroreflection into the laser cavity.

We decided to keep the reference arm fixed and build the moving platform in the test arm.

the attuator had a backlash problem which we had to solve.

Because we were working directly under a ventilation shaft we had to enclose the MZ in a box with *** black material to avoid disturbances due to the air movement.

\subsection{Improvements}
As a technical improvement corner cube rectroreflector should be used for a better alignment and less sensibility to the mirrors movement.

The use of corner cube retroreflectors, depending on the kind employed, may lead to parity problems, as the beam may not reflect the same number of times in both arms.
In our system, though, this is not a problem, as the presence of the pinhole eliminate any symmetry problem

To eliminate the needs of a numerical phase correction there are two possible ways.
A solution is to remove the filter and substitute the first beamsplitter with one which conveys more energy to the reference arm than to the test arm.
To obtain a disrete fringe contrast, though, the energy in the two arms should be as similar as possible.
Given the fact that we obtained good fringes contrast with a stack of heavy (ND up to optical density $d=5$), it means that we need a beamsplitter which transmit $10^{-5}$ of the incident intensity and reflects the remaining ($\simeq 1$).
Another solution is to balance the two arms by adding a slab of the same material and thickness of the ND filter in the test arm.

Both solutions lead to the generation of a interferogram with thinner fringes.
This is a problem because the attuator we used in the esperiment has a minimum step of \SI{47.625}{\nm}, which is not enough small for the resolution required by the new interferogram.
