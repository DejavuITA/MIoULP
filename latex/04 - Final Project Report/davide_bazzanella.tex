\section*{Abstract}
%\begin{•}
We replicate a method for multidimensional characterisation of ultrafast laser pulses\cite{miranda} with slight variation.
The technique is based on Fourier transform spectral interferometry and is spatially resolved in three dimensions.

The sample beam is interfered with a delayed copy of itself, passed through a pinhole, therefore spatially uniform.
The interferogram is acquired on each pixel of a CMOS camera by scanning the delay between the sample and the reference pulse and it allows us to gather high-resolution spatially resolved information on the phase difference between the two pulses.
This information is then elaborated by mean of Fourier transform along with the spectral amplitude and phase obtained with a SEA-F-SPIDER to obtain a complete characterisation of the original pulse in three spatial dimensions (or two plus time).

\section{Introduction}
%\begin{•}
Modern mode-locked lasers are able to generate ultrafast laser pulses with a duration down to a few femtoseconds \cite{tamura93,schriever14,yu30} and with high repetition rates.
Those pulses are too short to be characterised by any present-day detector, therefore correlation, spectrographic and interferometric techniques are largely used in laser metrology.

Autocorrelation and cross-correlation are by far the most used methods, because of their simplicity.
Since these techniques are the easiest techniques available, especially autocorrelation, they allow to obtain only moderate information on the laser pulse.
Also they often need to assume the shape of test pulse to estimate its duration.

Among the spectrographic techniques, the most common one is the so called Frequency-Resolved Optical Gating (FROG).
This method involves measuring the spectrum of the test pulse as a function of the delay between its replicas.
Amplitude and phase information on the ultrashort pulse is then extracted using an iterative-Fourier-transform algorithm.

Spectral-Phase Interferometry for Direct Electric-field Reconstruction (SPIDER) is an implementaton of shearing interferometry and is the most known interferometric method.
A SPIDER apparatus creates two replicas of the test pulse with a certain delay and mixes them with the original pulse in a crystal with nonlinear properties (usually cut for Sum-Frequency Generation).
The output from the crystal is then analysed with a spectrometer and the complete reconstruction of the pulse is obtained through a direct algebraic relation with the data.
%tomography ?

These techniques are usually implemented considering the laser pulse as transversely homogeneous.
This is often not the case, because distortions in the pulse spatial distribution may be introduced even by simple optical elements \cite{bor}.

Mutidimensional characterisation of a ultrafast laser pulse is often based on multiplexing of one of the forementioned techniques.
To give an example, SPIDER can be easily multiplexed to characterise one spatial dimension and the time dependence of the ultrafast pulse.
Also FROG can be scaled to allow the characterisation of one spatial dimension too.

Full (3D) characterisation of an ultrafast laser pulse requires further multiplexing or mixing different techniques into a more complex one.

\subsection{Aims}
%\begin{•}
The aim of this project is to obtain a complete spatial and temporal characterisation of an ultrafast laser pulse, that is a three dimensional (3D) characterisation.
%The aim of this project is to spatially and temporally characterise an ultrafast laser pulse of \SI{3.5}{\fs} duration.

Our plan is to build a Mach-Zender interferometer to obtain a spatially resolved interferogram of the laser pulse, and convert it to the frequency domain via Fourier transform.
Then, by adding information on phase and amplitude frequency dependence, gathered using the SEA-F-SPIDER already available in the laboratory, we will characterise the beam spatial distribution in three dimensions.

The source to be sampled is a Ti:Sapphire laser which generates \SI{30}{\fs} pulses, successively spectrally broadened by a hollow core fiber and temporally compressed by broadband chirped mirrors into the final \SI{3.5}{\fs} pulse with a bandwidth that spans from \SI{500}{\nm} to \SI{1000}{\nm}.
%\end{}

\clearpage
\section{Fourier transform spectral interferometry}
Among the different techniques, we have chosen to develop a spatially resolved version of the Fourier transform spectral interferometry.
This method is based on the interference between the test beam and a reference beam, which is often a small homogeneous portion of a copy of the test pulse.

\subsection{Cross-correlation interferometry}
%\begin{•}
Consider an unknown laser pulse, its time complex field and the corresponding field in the spectral domain are given by
\begin{gather}
	U(t) = |U(t)|e^{i\phi(t)} \\
	\tilde{U}(\omega) = |\tilde{U}(\omega)|e^{i\psi(\omega)}
	\label{eq_def}
\end{gather}
which are linked together by Fourier transform $U(t) = \mathrm{FT}^{-1} \lbrace \tilde{U}(\omega) \rbrace$ and $\tilde{U}(\omega) = \mathrm{FT} \left\lbrace U(t) \right\rbrace$

Cross-correlation interferometry considers the pattern given by the intensity of the interference between two fields with a relative delay $\tau$.
Since the sensor measures the intensity of the fields over a time much longer than a single cycle, we may write:
\begin{align}
	I(\tau) 	&= \int|U_1(t)+U_2(t-\tau)|^2\mathrm{d}t \nonumber\\
			&= \int|U_1(t)|^2\mathrm{d}t + \int|U_2(t)|^2\mathrm{d}t \nonumber\\
			&\quad + \int U_1(t)U_2^*(t-\tau)\mathrm{d}t + \int U_1^*(t)U_2(t-\tau)\mathrm{d}t 
	\label{eq_xcorr}
\end{align}
As we can see the first two terms are actually just the irradiance of the first beam $I_1 = \int|U_1(t)|^2\mathrm{d}t$ and of the second beam $I_2 = \int|U_2(t)|^2\mathrm{d}t$ and are therefore constant for each value of delay $\tau$.
Those components may be isolated and subtracted to the interferogram either by separate measurements or by removing the peak at $\omega = 0$ in the frequency domain.

The last two terms correlate the two fields together and afterwards may be adapted differently according to the approach chosen.
%\end{}

\subsection{Fourier transform spectral interferometry}
%\begin{•}
A special case of the cross-correlation interferometry is the test-plus-reference interferometry which tries to gather information on a test field $U(t)$ by correlating its interference pattern with a reference (known) field $U_r(t)$.
Our method, Fourier transform spectral interferometry, is the most common form of test-plus-reference interferometry.

Starting from cross-correlation intensity information and applying the Fourier transform to Eq. (\ref{eq_xcorr}) we obtain
%\begin{align}
%	\mathrm{FT} \lbrace I(\tau) \rbrace
%	&= \mathrm{FT} 	\left\lbrace	\int|U(t)|^2\mathrm{d}t + \int|U_r(t)|^2\mathrm{d}t +
%							\int U(t)U_r^*(t-\tau)\mathrm{d}t + \int U^*(t)U_r(t-\tau)\mathrm{d}t
%					\right\rbrace \nonumber\\
%	&= \mathrm{FT}	\left\lbrace \int|U(t)|^2\mathrm{d}t + \int|U_r(t)|^2\mathrm{d}t \right\rbrace
%	+ \tilde{U}(\omega)\tilde{U}_r^*(\omega)
%	+ \tilde{U}^*(-\omega)U_r(-\omega)
%	\label{eq_FTspectrum}
%\end{align}
\begin{align}
	\mathrm{FT} \lbrace I(\tau) \rbrace
	&= \mathrm{FT} 	\left\lbrace	
						\int|U(t)|^2\mathrm{d}t + \int|U_r(t)|^2\mathrm{d}t
					\right\rbrace \nonumber\\
	&+
		\mathrm{FT}	\left\lbrace	
						\int U(t)U_r^*(t-\tau)\mathrm{d}t
					\right\rbrace
	+	\mathrm{FT}	\left\lbrace	
						\int U^*(t)U_r(t-\tau)\mathrm{d}t
					\right\rbrace \\
	\label{eq_FTspectrum}
\end{align}
which, employing the convolution theorem, can be written as
\begin{align}
	\mathrm{FT} \lbrace I(\tau) \rbrace
	&= \mathrm{FT}	\left\lbrace \int|U(t)|^2\mathrm{d}t + \int|U_r(t)|^2\mathrm{d}t \right\rbrace \nonumber \\
	&+ \tilde{U}(\omega)\tilde{U}_r^*(\omega)
	+ \tilde{U}^*(-\omega)U_r(-\omega)
	\label{eq_FTspectrum1}
\end{align}
where $\tilde{U}(\omega)$ is the spectral domain complex field, as in Eq. (\ref{eq_def}).

The first term is the Fourier transform of a constant and is represented in the frequency domain by a peak at $\omega = 0$.
The second and third terms are represented by two peaks around $\omega_0$ and $-\omega_0$, where $\omega_0$ the main frequency of the pulse.
Figure (\ref{fig_spectrum}) is a representation from actual data in a lin-log scale of the spectrum amplitude.

	\label{fig_spectrum}
\end{figure}

Considering only the second term, which can be isolated from the term at zero and its symmetric at $-\omega$, we can define:
\begin{align}
	A(\omega) 	&\equiv \mathrm{FT} \left\lbrace \int U(t)U_r^*(t-\tau)\mathrm{d}t \right\rbrace \\
				&= \tilde{U}(\omega)\tilde{U}_r^*(\omega) \nonumber\\
				&= |\tilde{U}(\omega)||\tilde{U}_r^*(\omega)|e^{i[\psi(\omega)-\psi_r(\omega)]}
\end{align}
%\begin{equation}
%	A(\omega) \equiv |\tilde{U}(\omega)||\tilde{U}_r^*(\omega)|e^{i[\psi(\omega)-\psi_r(\omega)]}
%\end{equation}
from which we can eventually get:
\begin{equation}
	\tilde{U}(\omega) = |\tilde{U}(\omega)|e^{i\psi(\omega)} = \frac{A(\omega)}{|\tilde{U}_r^*(\omega)|}e^{i\psi_r(\omega)}
	\label{eq_complex_mono_w}
\end{equation}

The steps described work for an ideal setup and for a one dimensional characterisation.
We will expand the theoretical description later in the subsection \textit{Multidimensional approach} of section \ref{sec_data_analysis}.

\section{System setup}
\subsection{Ultrafast laser pulses source}
%\begin{•}
Our source of ultrafast laser pulses is a Ti:Sapphire laser which generates pulses of \SI{30}{\fs} with an energy of \SI{700}{\milli\J} at a repetition rate of \SI{1}{\kHz}.
These pulses are successively spectrally broadened in a \SI{1}{\m} long hollow fibre (\SI{250}{\um} inner core diameter) and then compressed in time by ultrabroadband chirped mirrors.
The compression is eventually fine-tuned by a pair of fused silica wedges, to obtain at the end of the process an ultrafast laser pulse of \SI{3.8}{\fs} duration and energy up to \SI{250}{\milli\J}.

The ultrafast laser pulse is generated on an optical table and then, through reflective optics only, conveyed to our system, which is on a different optical table.

This source is rather unique and we had therefore to schedule its use compatibly with the other people in the research group.
% and also to be assisted by our supervisor.
%\end{}

\subsubsection*{HeNe CW laser}
%\begin{•}
We also used a collimated HeNe laser, generating a continuous wave of wavelength $\lambda_{HeNe}=\SI{632.8}{\nm}$.
With its long coherence length and small beam waist was a useful prealignment tool.
%\end{}

\subsection{Mach-Zender interferometer}
%\begin{}
Our setup obtains the intensity pattern generated by the interference between a test pulse and a reference pulse.
The latter created by generating a replica of the test pulse with a beamsplitter (BS1) and passing it through a pinhole (PH).
The replica and the test pulse are temporally separated by a relative delay witch can be modifed by moving the platform.
%\end{}

\input{system_scheme.tex}

%\begin{•}
\subsubsection*{Components}
\begin{itemize}
	\item 5$\times$ Ø1" metallic mirrors (M1, M2, M3, M4, M5)
	\item 1$\times$ Ø1" 90 off-axis parabolic mirror, protected gold coated (OAP)
	\item 2$\times$ Ø1" broadband 50/50 beamsplitter with antireflection coating (BS1, BS2)
	\item 1$\times$ \SI{20}{\um} pinhole (PH)
	\item 1$\times$ moving platform with Zaber T-NA08 A 25 actuator
	\item 1$\times$ Allied Vision Guppy Pro F503B 12-bit 5MPixel CMOS camera
	\item 2$\times$ neutral density (ND) filters
	\item 1$\times$ 11$\times$16" steel breadboard
\end{itemize}
All the components have been fixed on the breadbord with common clamps, screws and washers.
All the mirrors have been mounted on pillars of the same height, exept for the two positioned on the the moving platform (M3, M4).
Those two mirrors, the beamsplitters and the pinhole have been mounted on pillars of different height to keep the center of the optical elements approssimately at the same height throughout the beam path.
%\end{}

\subsubsection{Assembling}
%\begin{•}
The Mach-Zender interferometer was initially assembled with six plain mirrors and no pinhole.
To test the rough alignment of the two output beam, we used the HeNe gaussian beam because of its small waist and because it is relatively safer than the Ti:Sapphire.
Each arm had three mirrors to preserve the mirroring parity and to avoid retroreflection into the laser cavity.

Due to the difficulties in alignment of the beam with the axis of movement of the platform, we decided to keep the reference arm fixed and build the moving platform in the test arm.
This choice avoided the problem of focusing the beam into the pinhole for every step of the platform.
In fact even the smallest misalignment between the beam path and the axis movement of the platform could move the beam from the center of the pinhole to the side, causing the loss of a high fraction of the reference beam energy.
Keeping the energies of the two beams at approximately the same value is a critical issue because it is related to the fringes contrast: a high difference means low contrast and therefore high noise in the data.
Consequently we removed the last plane mirror from the reference arm and replaced it with an off-axis parabolic mirror and a pinhole.
After a preliminary stage of alignment carried out with the HeNe laser, we started working with the Ti:Sapphire pulsed light.

At the end of the assembling phase we enclosed the breadboard in a box of black hardboard to block stray or unwanted light and avoid  disturbances due to the air movement, because we were working almost directly under a ventilation shaft.
This removed sensibly vibration in the acquired data and allowed us to reduce the number of pictures taken for each sampling step, thus spending less time for the whole acquisition.
%\end{}

\subsubsection*{Zero delay position}
%\begin{center}
One of the most difficult parts in the calibration of our system was without doubt finding the zero delay position.
We had to obtain the same optical path lenght for both the reference and the test arms.
Both arms had approximately the same length but we had to improve our accuracy up to a few microns in optical path difference.

	\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.45\textwidth}

Both images show the spatial fringes due to the paraboloid form of the reference beam.}
\end{figure}

In Figure (\ref{fig_interference}) and (\ref{photo_interference}) are represented the spatial fringes obtained for a point near the zero delay position.
They are caused by the fact that the reference beam has a different delay depending on the position on the sensor.
In fact, after the pinhole, the reference beam is well modeled by a paraboloid wave.

To obtain a high fringes contrast as in the figures above, the energy in the two arms should be as similar as possible.
Our beamsplitter (BS1) divided the beam equally in the two arms.
However the presence of the \SI{20}{\um} pinhole in the reference arm lowered significantly the energy of the output reference beam.
For this reason we included a neutral density filter in the test path in order to restore the balance in the beam energies.
%\end{center}

\subsection{SEA-F-SPIDER}
%\begin{•}
In the laboratory a variation from the traditional SPIDER apparatus was already available: spatially encoded arrangement for direct electric field reconstruction by spectral shearing interferometry (SEA-SPIDER) with direct spatial filtering for ancilla preparation (SEA-F-SPIDER).

This apparatus, compared to SPIDER, is particularly fitted for few-cycle pulse characterisation and is able to reconstruct the time dependence and the spatial distribution in one dimension of the pulse.

For our purposes, the temporal characterisation of a single spatial point (the central one) was sufficient.
%\end{}

\clearpage
\section{Data Analysis}
\label{sec_data_analysis}
%\begin{•}
Our output data is composed by the interferograms of each pixel of the camera and from the amplitude and phase frequency dependence gathered by the SEA-F-SPIDER.
All the interferograms are arranged in a big 3D matrix, whose dimensions are given by the resolution of the sensor and the number of steps from the samplig in the delay line.
Considering a 12-bit color (greyscale) depth and the original resolution of the camera ($2588\times 1940$), the memory usage of the raw data for 1024 sampling steps is more than 7 GB.
To keep memory usage lower we binned together pixels in $4\times 4$ groups obtaining an effective resolution of $647\times 485$ and a reduction of a factor 16 in the memory usage.
During the code development and debugging phases we reduced the memory usage further by cropping the resolution to $201\times 201$ in the center of the sensor.
%\end{}

\subsection{Multidimensional approach}
%\begin{•}
To expand Eq. \ref{eq_complex_mono_w} to comprehend two spatial dimensionalities we have to add the spatial dependence to the definition of the complex fields in the time and frequency domains.
\begin{gather}
	U(x,y,t) = |U(x,y,t)|e^{i\phi(x,y,t)} \\
	\tilde{U}(x,y,\omega) = |\tilde{U}(x,y,\omega)|e^{i\psi(x,y,\omega)}
	\label{eq_redef}
\end{gather}
from which, following the same steps as before, we get
\begin{equation}
	\tilde{U}(x,y,\omega) = \frac{A(x,y,\omega)}{|\tilde{U}_r^*(x,y,\omega)|}e^{i\psi_r(x,y,\omega)}
\end{equation}

To solve this equation we need to know the cross-correlation term $A(x,y,\omega)$ and the characterisation of the reference in amplitude $|\tilde{U}_r^*(x,y,\omega)|$ and phase $e^{i\psi_r(x,y,\omega)}$.
However the information on the reference that we obtain from the SEA-F-SPIDER measurement has no spatial dimensionality (or at most one, which is not enough).

For this reason the reference beam is made spatially homogeneous by the off-axis parabola and the pinhole.
Hence we can make the following assumptions:
\begin{itemize}
\item the intensity of the reference beam is homogeneous in the transverse directions $|\tilde{U}(x,y,\omega)|=|\tilde{U}(x_0,y_0,\omega)|=|\tilde{U}(\omega)|$ where ($x_0$,$y_0$) are the coordinates of the center of the beam.
\item the phase is separable as a spatial component and an angular frequency component:\\ $\psi_r(x,y,\omega) = \psi_{r,sp}(x,y,\omega)\psi_{r,\omega}(\omega)$
\end{itemize}
Then:
\begin{equation}
	\tilde{U}(x,y,\omega) \approx \frac{A(x,y,\omega)}{|\tilde{U}_r^*(\omega)|}e^{i\psi_r(x,y,\omega)}e^{i\psi_r(\omega)}
\end{equation}

The first assumption is valid because the reference beam is created by focusing the beam into a \SI{20}{\um} pinhole.
This produces on the camera sensor an Airy pattern.
As a first approximation the central area of the pattern may be considered homogeneous in intensity.
This area is the Airy disk which has a radius given by
$$\rho_s = 1.22 \frac{\lambda d}{D}$$
where $\lambda$ is the wavelength, $d$ is the distance between the aperture and camera and $D$ is the diameter of the aperture.\\
In our experiment the worst case values are $\lambda = \SI{500}{\nm}$, $D = \SI{20}{\um}$ and $d \approx \SI{300}{\mm}$ and give $\rho_s = \SI{9.15}{\mm}$ which is greater than both the height and the width of the sensor ($4 \times 6 \si{\mm}$)

\clearpage
The second assumption is motivated by the fact that we are not in possess of a complete spatial characterisation of the reference phase.
This allows us to remove the transverse spatial dependence of the phase directly in the frequency domain.
Furthermore air is considered as a non dispersive medium (throughout the whole discussion).

Considering the spherical wave generated by the pinhole, we can apply the Fresnel approximation for the medium-far field to obtain a paraboloid wave which is modeled by:
\begin{equation*}
U(x,y,z) \simeq \frac{A}{z}e^{-ikz}e^{ik\frac{x^2+y^2}{2z}}
\end{equation*}
where $z$ is the propagation direction and $k=\omega n/c \simeq \omega/c$.

Hence we can define the spatial dependence of the refence phase $\psi_r(x,y)$ as
\begin{equation}
	\psi_r(x,y) = k\frac{x^2+y^2}{2z} = \frac{\omega}{c}\frac{x^2+y^2}{2z}
\end{equation}

If we plot the phase\footnote{Note that to obtain a smooth function of the phase is not as simple as it looks. It is quite a complex problem and it is referred as '\texttt{2D unwrapping problem}'} of the cross-correlation term in the $x-y$ plane for an arbitrary value of delay we see something as represented in Figure (\ref{fig_paraboloid}).
This profile is easily parametrised by a two dimensional polinomial fit which afterwards can be analytically subtracted to the data.

\end{figure}
%\end{}

\subsection{Code development}
%\begin{}
\subsubsection*{Acquisition code}
To sample the interferograms we captured pictures at each delay step.
For this purpose we wrote a MATLAB script which employed dedicated functions already available to remotely move the attuator and control the CMOS camera.

After the first data acquisition, we discovered that the attuator corrupted the first points of the data due to its backlash at the initial position.
We solved the problem by moving the attuator further back and forcing him to take a few steps in the right direction before placing it on the first sampling position.

All the raw data was saved and then opened with a second MATLAB script.

	\caption{diagram representing the main steps of the data processing.}
	\label{diagram}
\end{wrapfigure}
The script which processed the raw data is composed mainly by the next steps:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Fourier transform the interferogram from the time (delay) domain into the frequency domain, for each pixel of the array.
	\item Isolate the cross-correlation term with a gaussian filter.
	\item Correct the phase of the cross-correlation term which contains also a phase due to the dispersion of the pulse in the ND filter.
	\item Multiply the cross-correlation term with the information on the reference beam (spectral amplitude and phase from the SEA-F-SPIDER measurement and spatial dependence of the phase from the numerical fit).
	\item Apply an inverse Fourier transform on the data to move back to the time domain, obtaining the complete characterisation.
\end{enumerate}

After the transition to the frequency domain, we had to isolate the cross-correlation term from the rest.
We choose to apply a gaussian filter on the whole frequency domain, as represented in Figure (\ref{fig_filter}).
The filter was generated by elevating to an arbitrarly high power a gaussian function centered on the main frequency of the pulse, as to simulate a top-hat function with a continuous one.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.9]{data/filter}
	\caption{(Color Online) Spectral amplitude and gaussian filter of an arbitrary single spatial point. The frequency domain has been restricted to the bandwidth of the cross-correlation term.}
	\label{fig_filter}
\end{figure}

In the next step we had to compensate for the dispersion due to the ND filter glass (N-BK7).
We modelled a phase correction with:

\begin{equation}
	\phi(x,y,\omega) = \frac{\omega}{c}\left( \mathrm{n}_{ND}(\omega) - \mathrm{n}_{air}(\omega)\right)\mathrm{L}_{ND}
\end{equation}
where $\mathrm{n}_{ND}$ and $\mathrm{n}_{air} \approx 1$ are the refractive indeces of N-BK7 glass and air, and L$_{ND}$ is the width of the ND filter, which we measured with a caliper.

In Figure (\ref{fig_phase_correction}) are represented the original cross-correlation spectral phase and the new one, corrected for the glass dispersion.
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.9]{data/phase_correction}
	\caption{(Color Online) Original cross-correlation phase and dispersion corrected phase of an arbitrary single spatial point.}
	\label{fig_phase_correction}
\end{figure}

As we can see, the two big slopes, due to the dispersion of the ND filter, have been removed and the new phase function is flatter compared to the original one.
As a matter of fact a flat phase function is expected for the cross-correlation term gathered from a balanced Mach-Zender interferometer.

Afterwards we had to divide by the spectral amplitude of the reference and add its spectral phase to the data, obtaining the complex field in the frequency domain.
Both spectral amplitude and phase are represented in Figure (\ref{fig_SPIDER_data}) in a plot with a frequency domain restricted to the pulse bandwidth.
\begin{figure}

	\includegraphics[scale=0.9]{data/spider_spectrum_phase}
	\caption{(Color Online) Spectral amplitude and phase of the reference beam gathered through the SEA-F-SPIDER measurement.}
	\label{fig_SPIDER_data}
\end{figure}

The last step was to apply an inverse Fourier transform on the data to obtain the complex field in the time domain and therefore the complete three dimensional characterisation.
%\end{}
\subsection{Results}
Unfortunately the numerical algorithms did not work properly and we obtained the true information on the pulse shape hidden under high noise.

To show that what we are watching is after all the correct measurement, we can force the phase of the cross-correlation term - after the gaussian filter - to zero.
With this escamotage we obtain the result displayed in Figure (\ref{fig_result}), which clearly shows a pulse with a full width at half height (FWHM) of \SI{3.7}{\fs}.
This means that the true information on the pulse shape is hidden inside the cross-correlation term, therefore implies that the Mach-Zender Interferometer is working as intended and the problems are to be searched for in the analysis algorithms.

\section{Conclusions}
\subsection{Improvements}
%\begin{•}
To eliminate the numerical phase correction there are two possible ways.
A solution is to remove the filter and substitute the first beamsplitter with one which conveys more energy to the reference arm than to the test arm.
However to obtain a fairly good fringes contrast, the energy in the two arms should be as similar as possible.
Given the fact that we obtained good fringes contrast with a stack of heavy (ND up to optical density $d=5$), it means that we need a beamsplitter which transmits $10^{-5}$ of the incident intensity and reflects the remaining ($\simeq 1$).
Another solution is to balance the two arms by adding a slab of the same material and thickness of the ND filter in the test arm.

Both solutions lead to the generation of an interferogram with thinner fringes.
This may be a problem because the attuator we used in the esperiment has a minimum step of \SI{47.625}{\nm}, which translates into an effective delay step of $c\cdot\SI{95.25}{\nm}$ due to the fact that the beam travels twice along the directon of the delay line.
This step is just right to sample the shortest wavelenght in the ultrafast laser source bandwidth ($\sim \SI{500}{\nm}$), but may not be small enough to obtain a good sampling for the resolution required by the new interferogram.

As an additional technical improvement corner cube rectroreflector may be used for a better alignment and less sensibility to the mirrors movement.

The use of corner cube retroreflectors, depending on the kind employed, may lead to parity problems, as the beam may not reflect the same number of times in both arms.
However, in our system this is not a problem, as the presence of the pinhole eliminate any symmetry problem.

\subsection{Personal considerations}
%\begin{}
At the beginning, I had to become familiar with the environment and the equipement in the
laboratory and the system itself required high precision due to the extreme conditions of the physics involved (\si{\fs}, \si{\nm}).
Therefore a considerable amount of time was spent on the building of the Mach-Zender interferometer, on its alignment procedures and on the balancing of the two arms of the interferometer.
Even though we did not obtain a complete result as hoped, we accomplished several intermediate achievements, such as the assembly of a working Mach-Zender interferometer.

A strong positive point was also given by the possibility to work in an actual research environment, rather than in a academic laboratory.
For these reasons I am satisfied of the skill gained and I consider this as a positive formative experience.
